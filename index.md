# 1.1 Hydrological Cycle
* closed system
* Water is held in number of stores and then moves between them by flows called transfers
![8fdcd3c418a9609d7f00e8b1af40e541.png](:/dbcc1e82872245c4b81b7eb69e4c291f)
## Stores
* Atmosphere - water exists either as water vapor
* Land - water is stored on surface of 
	* rivers, lakes and reservoirs
	* below ground in the bed rock
	* Taken in by plants and stored in vegetation for short period
	* ground water below ground and aquifer
	* snow and ice as slid form in glaciers and snowfields
* The sea - estimation of over 95 percent of water is stored in sea

** the water in the hydrological cycle cannot change but the proportions held in different locations can caused by sun's energy

## Flows (transfers)
* Evaporation - starts with evaporation due to the heat of the sun
* transpiration - plants take up liquid water from the soil and released as vapor
* Evapotranspiration- the loss of moisture from the ground by direct evaporation from water bodies and the soil, plus transpiration from the plants
* Condensation - change in atmosphere when water vapor cools to become liquid
* Precipitation - rain, hail or snow from atmosphere to the land or sea surface
* Overland flow - most precipitation flows into stream, river or lake, known as run off
* Infiltration and percolation - downwards through the soil and rock into aquifer or groundwater store
	* infiltration happens on surface and percolation happens afterwards
* Throughflow - between the ground surface and the top of the ground water store
* Groundwater flow - in the rocks of the aquifer and transfer water to rivers, lakes and sea underground

# 1.2 Drainage Basin
### open system and small scale hydrological cycle

![e238091e7e3d6215f75e19fe79a519d6.png](:/146ea4279c424d29a5df0f0e452a6022)

### inputs:
* energy from the sun
* precipitation formed from moisture picked up outside the basin
* water from tributary drainage basins
### outputs:
* river's discharge
* water in basin from evaporation and transpiration happen
	* (water falls as precipitation in another drainage basin)

Def: 
* Watershed: tops of the hills that separate drainage basins
* Tributaries - smaller streams
* Confluences - where smaller river merge or enter the main river channel
* mouth/estuary - where water flows into the sea
* Channel network - system of surface and underground channels that collect and transports the precipitation falling on the drainage basin

### types of drainage basin:
* simply connect and deliver water directly to the sea
* parts of much larger drainage basins
* lead to 'inland' seas or lakes such as Caspian Sea

### factors affecting run off:
* rapid run off - steep slopes; impermeable rock
* little run off - permeable rock: rivers have disappeared underground
* woodland - slow rate of run off
* urban area - speeds up rate of run off

# 1.3 River Regimes and Hydrographs

![fd46117f70918168690c96551c4d3d75.png](:/a6ecd2dbd43e4927be738a63cf4a5864)

Def: 
* River regime - Variation of discharge throughout the year
* hydrograph - graph with the variation of river discharge

## Storm Hydrographs
def - records the changing discharge of a river after a rainstorm
* bar graph - shows rainfall
* line graph - shows discharge of river
* base flow - 'normal' discharge of river
* storm flow - additional discharge of the river as a result of the rainstorm

## Factors Affecting River Regimes
* Amount and intensity of rain. 
	* heavy rain will not sink into the ground and become overland flow 
* Temperature affect the form of precipitation
	* if temperature is below freezing, precipitation will be snow and take slower to melt
* Steep slows cause rapid surface run off
* Rock type - impermeable rocks will not allow rainwater to sink into
* Vegetation and land use - trees and other plants intercept and delay the rain reaching the ground
* Human intervention - dams and reservoirs are interventions in river regimes

# 1.4 Fluvial Processes
Three processes that shape land forms ==erosion, transport and deposition==
These partner with two other processes - ==weathering and mass movement==

Def: 
* Physical weathering - breaks rocks down into smaller and smaller pieces
	* done by changes in temperatures and by rainfall freezing and thawing in rock cracks
* Chemical Weathering - Causes rocks to decay and disintegrate
	* Largely done by slightly acidic rain seeping into porous rocks
* Biological weathering - roots of plants, especially trees, growing into cracks in the rocks gradually split the rock apart
* Slumping - occurs when 
	* bottom of valley slide slope is cut away by the river flowing at its base. 
	* makes the slope unstable and weathered material slumps down towards the river
	* also happens when slope is saturated by heavy rain
* Soil Creep - weathered material moves slowly down slope under the influence of gravity

## Erosion:
Def:
* Hydraulic action - Water hits the river bed and banks with force that material is dislodged and carried away. (most likely to happen when river discharge is high)
* Abrasion - Material being carried by river is rubbed against the side and floor of the channel. (sandpaper action widens and deepens the channel)
* Corrosion/Solution - Minerals in the rock forming the sides of the river channels are dissolved by the water flowing past them
* Attrition - Particles of material being carried by a river, and becoming rounder and smaller as they collide with each other

## Transport 
def: movement of material (load) by the river

Def: 
* Solution - material dissolved in the water
* Traction - Large boulders rolled on the bed
* Saltation - Small boulders bounded along the bed
* Suspension - lighter material carried along by river flow

### Deposition:
def: laying down of material previously transported by the river. Happens when there is a decrease in the energy, speed and discharge of the river
(mostly like to happen when a river enters a lake or the sea)

# 1.5 Downstream Changes in River Characteristics
|Factors | Upstream | Downstream |
|---------|--------|-------------|
|Discharge| Less | More |
| Occupied Channel Width | Less | More |
| Channel Depth | Less | More| 
| Average Velocity | Less | More|
| Load Quantity | Less | More|
| Load Particle Size | More | Less |
| Channel Bed Roughness | More | Less |
| Slope Angle (Gradient) | More | Less| 

## Upper stream Landforms (mainly formed by erosion)
![1d7dd515df98306a1311a5e070217c47.png](:/21b6463e18e14f7099fbe4a4d5dcf975)
* steep V-shaped valleys - river has cut down by vertical erosion
* waterfalls - vertical erosion and falls back, soft rock and hard rock, makes plunge pool
* gorges - made when waterfalls retreat
* steep and river flows fast (not fastest)
* Hydraulic action and abrasion erode the bed rocks
* Valley floor is narrow
* Interlocking spurs - formed where the river swings from side to side

## Lower Stream Landforms
![18b07c1b6ac09821148f53a218a3b4b6.png](:/0daae87956f94f30acc7216608589f06)
* River Velocity and discharge increase
* Gentler gradient
* Floor occupied by a flood plain
* valley cross section wider and flatter
* Flood plain spreads out to become a delta or an estuary
* Levees Thickness of sediment in river from flooding and sediment movement
* Delta - vast areas of alluvium at the mouths of rivers
* Distributaries - Smaller channels made from river flow blocked by deposition

## Mid Stream Landforms
![10a903609a2d4c2afb819b0f44bea7de.png](:/d4225b5ed9de4222a67ab62f712053c1)
* Meanders - Erosion and deposition due to swinging of river. Difference in speed of outer and inner part of the river
* Ox Bow Lake - Meanders flood and the river shortcuts to isolate part of the river

# 1.7 Water Uses, Demand and Supply
## Uses
Although only 3 percent of water on earth is fresh water, fresh water is:
* essential to all life
* vital to economic
* Unevenly distributed, with some areas 'water-rich' and 'water-poor'

Fresh water is needed for:
* Domestic use - bathing and showering
* Industrial use - producing goods from beer to steel, generating electricity
* leisure use - sport fishing on rivers

All forms of water use revolve around two key elements:
* Demand - need for water for range of uses: also often referred as consumption
* Supply - meeting the demand for water by tapping various sources, such as ground water, lakes and rivers

### For any area, comparison of water demand and water supply is ==water balance==

## Demand

### water demand and consumption have increased in the last 100 years with global demand more than trebling over the last 50 years. 
This is because of
* growth of world's population, houses use piped water, toilets, and showers.
* rise in agricultural productivity needed to fee a growing population increases the use of water, particularly for irrigation 
* Industrialization require water to cool machinery 

## Supply
* Rivers and lakes - source used by the earliest humans
* Reservoirs - artificial lakes created by building a dam across a valley allowing it to flood
* Aquifers and wells - much of the world's fresh water supply lies underground

## Water Surplus and Defect
We can have three types of areas:
* area where the water balance is negative - water demand exceeds supply
* area where the water balance is positive - water surplus areas where the supply or availability of water exceeds demand
* areas where water demand and supply are roughly the same - water neutral areas

## Sources of water pollution
### Agriculture
* Liquid from farms silage and slurry from farm animals enter rivers
* Fertilizers and pesticides seep into the ground water
* Deforestation - run off carries soil and slit into rivers, with serious effects on aquatic life and humans who drink the water

### Industry
* Taking cooling water for an electric power station and returning it at a higher temperature damages ecosystems
* Spillage from industrial plants such as oil refineries can enter rivers
* Working on metallic minerals can produce toxic substances

### Domestic
* The discharge of untreated sewage from houses - even treated sewage pollutes
* User of river for washing and bathing contaminates water
* Emptying highly chlorinated water from swimming pools

## Access to Safe Water

def:
Safe Water - water fit for human consumption, it is not contaminated by pollutants and is free from disease.

*** Estimated that more than 1 billion people do not have access to safe water


## Managing The supply of Clean Water

### Three Stages
* Collection
* Treatment
* Delivery

Collection - main sources of water are rivers, reservoirs and lakes, aquifers and wells

Treatment - rivers are often highly polluted. Important to remove suspended solids, bacteria, algae, viruses, fungi and chemical pollutants. The process include:
* chlorination - to control any biological growth 
* aeration - to remove dissolved iron and manganese
* sedimentation - to remove very fine sediments
* disinfection - to kill bacteria


### Delivery
In developed countries, water is delivered by standpipes in the streets.
In villages, water from wells are often used untreated

# Case Study

# 4.1 Economic Sectors and Employment
Economic activity does three things:
* creates jobs (employment)
* generates income (wealth)
* produces something for sale or consumption

## Four Economic Sectors
Def:

* Primary sector - working with natural resources. (ex. farming, forestry, fishing, mining, and quarrying)
* Secondary sectors - processing things such as food or minerals (ex. manufacturing cars, microchips, or building)
* Tertiary sectors - providing services. (ex. transport, restaurants, cinemas, doctors, schools, etc.)
* Quaternary sector - concerned with information and communications (ICT) and research and development (ex. universities)

### Economy of a developing country relies heavily on the primary sector while economy of a developed country depends most on the tertiary sector

![dbba47c13e8c3abf854ad702030ea06e.png](:/ae05d1b9fe90465eaa15034fc377bd93)

Economic Measurements:
* GDP (Gross Domestic Products) - total value of goods and services produced by economy of a country during a year
* GNI (Gross national income) - GDP of a country plus all the income earned by investments abroad

As a country develops, proportion employed in the primary sector decreases and the proportion in the secondary and tertiary secors increase. 

![f39d921d2aa3c1d921acc86f97b43ff1.png](:/8ae72397656941cca35b631f501f5b20)

 ### Industrialization - Process by which an economy is changed from a primarily agricultural one to one based on the manufacturing of goods
### Stages of Industrializtion:
* Pre-industrial phase - primary sector leads the economy and may employ more than two-thirds of the working population. Agriculture is by far the most important activity
* Industrial phase - secondary and tertiary sectors increase in productivity. Primary sector declines in relativity.
* Post-industrial phase - tertiary sector is the most important sector. Primary and secondary sectors continue their relative decline. Quaternary sectors begin to appear. 


Subsistence farming - type of agriculture concerned with the production of items to meet the food and living needs of the farmers and their families

Commercial farming - type of agriculture in which production is intended for sale in markets

# 4.2 Factors Affecting The Locations of Economic Activities
### Factors influencing location:
* Raw materials
* Amenities
* Cheap land
* Employees
* Infrastructure
* Customers
* Good transport

Example of importance of location: 
* Heavy industry - raw materials are the top priority for industries such as steel, shipbuilding and chemicals, as well as the supply of energy. Good transport links are needed for assembling the raw materials and distributing the finished goods
* Research and development - it relies most on a highly-skilled workforce and access to the latest research being undertaken, usually in universities. 

Accessibility - ease with which one location is reached from another
CBD (Central Business District) - Includes skyscrapers and office buildings. Great accessibility 
Decentralization - movement of people, jobs and activities from the center of major cities to the suburbs and beyond

![9ba7349265ae773a871cd202b9520c38.png](:/ed56e2ac522f433bab725050aae17820)

# 4.3 Changes in Sector Employment

Clark-Fisher model is based on idea that as a country develops, the relative importance of the economic sectors change in terms of:
* their contribution to a country's economic effort ( GDP or GNI)
* Percentage of a country's labor force employed in each sector


## Causes of Change
* Raw Material - source of raw material often become exhausted. Manufacture may change their location. 
* New Technology - Advances are constant and technology and impact directly on the economic sectors. 
### Technology also reduce friction of distance thanks to modern communications and cheaper transport
* Globalization - process by which the countries of the world are being gradually drawn together into a single global economy by a growing network of links and organizations 
* Government policies - degree of government intervention
* Demographic and social change - populations change over time, mostly they grow
* 
![c3b45ed63deb57814764b13180d2abf9.png](:/9c164d87454146e3a5e3a07952cb981b)

Tertiary sector:
* allows people to earn more money
* allow people to have left over money (disposable income) to spend on non-essential goods
* people's preference change and impacts the tertiary sector

# 4.4 Sectors Shifts in Three Countries (Case Study)
Sector shifts - changes in the relative importance of the economic sectors that takes place as countries develop


# 4.5 Informal sector
Informal sector - fifth sector that is not recognized in the official figures produced by governments, also refereed as the 'black economy' because it is unofficial and unregulated

## Causes (Steps)
1.  Search for work and regular wage
2.  belief that the quality of life is better in towns and cities
3.  surplus labor means that there is underemployment and unemployment
4.  employers can only pay their workers very low wages
5.  wages are so low that they are not enough for a worker and their family
6.  to avoid poverty, many people must find other ways of making a living outside the normal job market

## Characteristics
Examples:
* Selling matches, shoelaces and ice cream in streets
* begging
* petty crime
* prostitution
* paratransit (arise because of the inadequate official transport in towns and cities in developing countries)

# Case Study - Dhaka, Bangladesh

# 4.6 Population and Resources
### Three different Views on growth:
* Malthus (1798) - first person to put forward a pessimistic view. Population growth proceeded at a faster rate than the increase in food supply. So there would come a time when there was no longer sufficient food to feed the population. Population growth would stop, either by a lowering of birth or a rise in death rate as a result of famine, disease and war. 
* Boserup (1965) - Increase in population stimulate an improvement in food production. So developments in technology would solve the problem
* The Club of Rome (1972) - limits to global population growth would be reached within the next 100 years if population and development continued at the rate of growth seen in the 1970s. However, they suggested that it would be possible to reduce the trends by means of growth-regulating processes. If this happened, sustainable triangular balance between population, development and resources might be reached. Presumably modern technology could also be used to reach the equilibrium. 



![358496e4549483289b8e6dd7bd754f9b.png](:/f4713f3ec7784b80bc447f0218daa887)

overpopulation - population numbers exceed resources; this is unsustainable
underpopulation - resources exceed population numbers; a rare situation
optimum population - population and resources are in a balance which is sustainable

## Achieving the right balance depends on:
* Controlling population growth, by family planning
* Reducing our own resource consumption by using resources much more efficiently and cutting out waste
* Using technology to discover and exploit new resources
* making sure that development is less based on natural resources

# 4.7 Rising Energy Demand
### Def:
Primary energy - fuels that provide energy without undergoing any conversion process (ex. coal, natural gas, fuelwood)
Secondary energy - include electricity, petrol, coke, made by processing of primary fuels
Non-renewable energy - Energy that cannot be replaced once used up
Renewable energy - can be used again and again

## Energy Demand

Demand for energy across the world is constantly rising
![cba38d9d260e691023e8cba22af66a0d.png](:/5c2e6537a45a4e918789ea654ac287f4)

## Energy Productions
Three quarters of the world's energy production comes from three sources: oil, natural gas and coal (all non renewable)
Major producers of energy are the USA, Canada, Western Europe, Russia, etc

## Energy Security

Energy security - when a country is able to meet all of its energy needs and reliability, preferably from within its own borders. 
Today, most countries face an energy gap between energy demand and energy supplies. 

## 4.8 Renewable Versus Non-Renewable Energy

### Non Renewable sources:
|Energy Source| Status | Description | Lifespan | Uses | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----|----|----|---|-----|---|-----|
|Coal | non-renewable fossil fuel | formed underground from decaying plant and animal matter| over 200 years | Electricity, heating, coke | high world reserves, newer miners are highly mechanized| pollution: CO2, causes global warming. SO2 caues acid rain. mining can be difficult and dangerous. Bulky to transport|
|Oil|non-renewable fossil fuel |formed underground from decaying animal and plant matter | about 50 years| electricity, petroleum, diesel, fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas, etc| variety of uses, fairly easy to transport, efficient, less pollution than coal|low reserves, some air pollution, danger of spills and explosions|
|Fuelwood|non renewable / renewable | trees, usually in natural environment, but can be grown specifically for fuel| Variable within each country | heating, cooking| easily available, collected daily by local people, free, replanting possible| trees are used up quickly, soil erosion, desertification, deforestation|
|Nuclear Energy|Classified by some as non renewable because of reliance on uranium as fuel: others regard it as renewable in that nuclear fuel may be re-used|heavy metal (uranium) element found naturally in rock deposits|unknown|used in a chain reaction to produce heat for electricity|clean, fewer greenhouse gasses, efficient, uses very small amounts of raw material|dangers of radiation, high cost of building|

## Renewable Sources
#### Often referred to as alternative energy
|Energy Source| Status | Description | Uses | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----|----|----|---|-----|---|
|Hydro|renewable|good, regular supply of water needed, water held in reservoir, channeled through pipes to a turbine|electricity|very clean, dams can control flooding, often in remote areas|large areas of land flooded, visual pollution|
|Geothermal|Renewable|Boreholes can be drilled below ground to use the Earth's natural heat to turn turbine|electricity, direct heating|Many potential sites, but most are in volcanic areas|sulfuric gasses, expensive to develop, high temperature|
|Wind|Renewable|wind drives blades to turn turbines|electricity|very clean, no air pollution, smalls scale and large scale schemes possible|winds are unpredictable, visual and noise pollution|
|Tidal|renewable|tidal water drives turbines|electricity|large schemes could produce a lot of electricity, clean, barrage can also protect coasts from erosion| very expensive to build, few suitable sites|
|Solar|renewable|solar panels or photovoltaic cells using sunlight|direct heating, electricity|could be used in most parts of the world, unlimited supply|expensive, needs sunlight and cloud/night mean solar energy is reduced|
|Biofuels and waste|renewable|fermented animal or plant waste or crops, refuse incineration| Ethanol, methane, electricity, heating|widely available, especially in LICs, uses waste products, can be used at a local level|can be expensive to set up, waste cannot be recycled|

# 4.9 Sustainable Energy
### Approach to sustainable energy:
* Energy must be used sparingly and with the utmost efficiency
* Non-renewable sources of energy are finite and must be conserved. 

### Reduce energy consumption:
* walk or cycle
* Insulation in houses
* Pack the empty spaces in freezers
* 'hibernate' electronics to save electricity
